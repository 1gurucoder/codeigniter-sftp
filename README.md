This is a Library for CodeIgniter that uses sFTP.  I've tried to keep the usage the exact same as the FTP 
library that is included with CodeIgniter.

1.  PHP 5.2
2.  PECL SSH2 Extension
3.  CodeIgniter 2.1.4+

Drop this file into the ./application/libraries/ folder in your CodeIgniter installation.
